> An interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language

It is the first programming language I learned, so I have quite a bit of
experience with it.

To manage dependencies I'm using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), for
testing [PyTest](https://pytest.org) and for linting
[PyLint](https://pylint.org).

And if you are curious my code editor is
[Neovim](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/UltiVim) ðŸ˜†

I'm using
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/tree/main/.github/workflows)
as continuos integration, every time I push a commit it runs
[CodeQL](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml),
[PyTest](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/blob/main/.github/workflows/pytest.yml)
and
[PyLint](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/python/blob/main/.github/workflows/pylint.yml).

I do some exercises and challenges every day in:
[UltiRequiem/daily-python-practice](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/daily-python-practice)

I solved all the
[Hacker Rank Python Problems](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/hacker-rank-python).
